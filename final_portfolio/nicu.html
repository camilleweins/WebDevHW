			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div class="text">The NICU (Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit) app prototype was intended to lower overall sound levels in the incubator ward of hospitals, where loud noises can be very harmful to the premature infants. Tasks were focused around successfully identifying and analyzing the problems that afflict nurses working in NICU wards with extensive user research, followed by designing and user testing the wire frame for the tablet application. </div>

		<section id="research">

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<div class="text">Research consisted of primary sources including an interview with a nurse currently working at the UCLA NICU, as well as blog posts from nurses around the country. Statistics and secondary information was used to round out our understanding of the problem so a solution could be adequately ideated. The consensus was that the current alarm system installed on incubators in the NICU ward were too disruptive, causing harm to the infant and stress on the nursing staff.</div>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<div class="text">A new alarm and monitoring application was wire-framed using the program Pop. The prototype underwent user testing to ensure that navigation was intuitive and the design supported a positive user experience. The final prototype was created using Invision.</div>
