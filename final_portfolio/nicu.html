			<h3>Background</h3>
			<div class="text">The NICU (Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit) app prototype was intended to lower overall sound levels in the incubator ward of hospitals, where loud noises can be very harmful to the premature infants. Tasks were focused around successfully identifying and analyzing the problems that afflict nurses working in NICU wards with extensive user research, followed by designing and user testing the wire frame for the tablet application. </div>
		</section>
		<section id="research">
			<img src="img/mind-map.png">
			<caption>These were preliminary ideas we mocked up to help us write interview questions. We decided to focus on sound levels.</caption>
			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<div class="text">Research consisted of primary sources including an interview with a nurse currently working at the UCLA NICU, as well as blog posts from nurses around the country. Statistics and secondary information was used to round out our understanding of the problem so a solution could be adequately ideated. The consensus was that the current alarm system installed on incubators in the NICU ward were too disruptive, causing harm to the infant and stress on the nursing staff.</div>

			<caption>We decided that our primary users are the nurses.</caption>
			<div class="text">Scenarios for Rachel
				<ul>
					<li>Rachel made sure to leave some of the care work that is normally part of her routine for the parents so they can learn how to take care of their child.</li>
					<li>Rachel is having a difficult time trying to be extra considerate of what the parents think is the right care taking method versus what the baby actually needs.</li>
					<li>She made sure to put an AngelEye camera over the baby's incubator so the parents could remotely monitor their child's wellbeing.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<div class="text">A new alarm and monitoring application was wire-framed using the program Pop. The prototype underwent user testing to ensure that navigation was intuitive and the design supported a positive user experience. The final prototype was created using Invision.</div>
			<h4>Wireframes</h4>
			<img src="img/nicu.017.png">
			<caption>The low fidelity wireframe is much smaller than the prototype. This was made with the intention of designing for a wearable.</caption>
			<br>
			<img src="img/nicu.020.png">
			<caption>This higher fidelity wireframe was scaled up to match the dimmensions of a tablet in landscape view. We ran into problems with navigation in that it took too many taps to get to the monitor screen.</caption>
